C_lang - Basic C Projects
Welcome to the C_lang repository! This collection features a series of simple yet educational C programming projects designed for beginners and enthusiasts looking to strengthen their understanding of the C programming language. Each project focuses on fundamental concepts, offering clear examples to help you learn and practice C programming effectively.
üìñ About
The C_lang repository is a curated set of basic C projects aimed at helping learners grasp essential programming concepts such as variables, loops, functions, arrays, and more. These projects are perfect for those new to C or anyone looking to revisit the basics through hands-on coding.
Whether you're a student, a hobbyist, or someone preparing for technical interviews, these projects provide a practical way to explore the power and simplicity of C.
üöÄ Projects
Below is a list of the projects included in this repository:

[Project Name 1] - A brief description of what this project does (e.g., a simple calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations).
[Project Name 2] - A brief description of what this project does (e.g., a program to manage a basic phonebook).
[Project Name 3] - A brief description of what this project does (e.g., a pattern-printing program using loops).
(More projects to be added as the repository grows!)

Each project is contained in its own folder with a dedicated source file (.c) and, where applicable, a brief explanation of the code.
üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run these projects, you'll need:

A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or any modern C compiler).
